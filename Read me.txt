Seoane, Hernan; Yurdagul, Emircan (2018), “Supporting Materials for "Trend Shocks and Sudden Stops"”


This file contains the codes and the data used to produce the results in "Trend Shocks and Sudden Stops" (May, 2019) by Hernan Seoane and Emircan Yurdagul.
First, we go over the files included for the model solution, and then through the data source and the figures in the paper.

READ ME: SOLUTION & SIMULATIONS

The 'solution_policies' file is the code we run to solve the policy functions. 
The 'params_end' file contains some key parameters to be read in the codes. The last entry in this file is set to "0" for decentralized solution, and "1" for the planner's solution.
The 'simulations' file reads the policy function and gives the simulated sample.
The codes are initially written to allow for shocks to kappa and omega. The current version still includes these in a degenerate way.
In order to run with only trend shocks, set n_z=1,n_zt=1,n_zn=1 in the solution file, and n_z=1 in the simulation file (with replace all).
In order to run with only transitory shocks, set n_g=1 in the solution and simulation files.
The random variables used for simulations are read from the files titled "randomXXX" included in the outputs folder.
'read_sim.do' file computes the statistics from the 'data_sim.txt' which gives the simulated model (Model columns in Table 3). 'read_sim_SP.do' produces the histogram of debt comparisons (Figure 6).

The folder 'Alternative' contains the additional files to compute the alternative (Bianchi 2011) model solution used in Figure 2. We use a modified version of our baseline codes for this alternative model. 
The solution file needs to be run together with the rest of the fortran files in the Alternative folder, which are originally supplied as supplementary files for Bianchi (2011), downloadable at https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.7.3400. 
(Some of these had to be modified to make compatible with our main code, so we include these here.)
'Alternative/outputs' subfolder contains all the input needed for the solution of this model.



READ ME: DATA & MATLAB
A file with the smoothed estimates of unobservables is included.

't_nt_crosscountry' includes data for figure 1, this data comes directly from the WDI and has multiple countries.

File 'ss_data_arg.mat' includes the average path for observables and smoothed estimates around sudden stops. This data is based on the raw data from Ferreres (2010) as cited in the paper.

Matlab files: 'figure_1', 'figures_2_3_5', 'figure_4' plot the figures in the paper.
